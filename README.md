# Guide-Linux-Commands

This guide is the collection of my personal notes when taking the online course <The Linux Command Line Bootcamp> by Colt Steele. I organized the concepts and commands demonstrated during the lectures into a consistent and structured way, with the goal of helping beginners to fast master the basic skills of Linux Command Lines. Sincere thanks to Colt Steele, for this is a very excellent course!
